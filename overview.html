<h1>CS262A: Advanced Topics in Computer Systems </h1>
  <br>
  <br>
  </h1>
<h1>Overview</h1>

The goal of the course is to cover a broad array of research topics in computer 
systems, and to engage you in systems research.&nbsp; The class is based on a 
discussion of important research papers and a research project. 
<p>
The main work of this class is to read frequently and deeply, while
working toward a group research project of publishable quality.&nbsp;
Each student will be individually responsible for writing up a short
summary of every paper. There will be one midterm exam (albeit near
the end), and no final exam. Research projects are a critical aspect
of the course.&nbsp; Your goal is to do some quality systems research;
that is, to add to our understanding of how to build systems.&nbsp;
Research projects must be written up in a term paper, and will be
presented in a poster in a departmental mini-conference.&nbsp;
Suggested project ideas will be provided by the instructors, but you
are strongly encouraged to come up with your own project ideas.&nbsp;
Potential projects include implementation or analysis of some piece of
an OS, a DBMS, or an Internet service; extending one of these systems
with new functionality; or measurement and analysis of existing
systems with the goal of better understanding issues in system
design.&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; <BR>


<h2>Prerequisites</h2> 

Advanced undergraduates allowed with permission of
instructor. Operating Systems (cs162) and Database Systems (cs186) are
required.
