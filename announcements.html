  <li>The deadline for checkpoint 2 is extended due to the eecs network outage. It is 11:59AM (noon) this Friday. 
  <li>There are a couple of changes to the webpage of project 1 regarding to checkpoint 2:
  <ol>
  <li> Project specification v1.2 is released. It includes important 
  information we discussed in newsgroup for checkpoint 1. </li>
  <li> The deadline for checkpoint 2 is 11:59pm instead of 5:00pm on the same day. </li>
  <li> Some hints for server implementation are posted in 
  "Hints & Tips" section. </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>TAs put up their discussion section notes online at the TA webpage.</li>
  <li>Project 1 is out. You are going to work on your own for this project:
  <ol>
  <li> A project specification provides you detail information about what
the project is and what you will do in the project.
  <li> A project template is provided to make the task tractable.
  <li> A code skeleton for client is provided to help you easily start
your own implementation.
  <li> A executable server is provided for you to debug your client.
  </ol> 
Please go to read the project webpage and specification carefully.
  <li>NOTE: Homework Set #1 is now due Friday, 10 September at 5 PM in
the homework box opposite 240 Cory labeled EE122.</li>
  <li>Some of the suggested sites in the ping&nbsp; exercise have
disabled pinging. Find alternative sites in the same cities if
necessary (e.g., www.temple.edu instead www.upenn.edu). If you discover
anomalous results (e.g., Philadelphia seems to be closer to Berkeley
than Los Angeles), run some other tests to different sites in those
cities to attempt to explain the anomalies (note that some sites may be
on faster networks than others or may have local caches near the Bay
Area, but this is unlikely to be the case for Podunk University!).</li>
  <li>In Problem 25 (Homework Set #1), "seven point-to-point links"
should be "six point-to-point links": Source -- R1 -- ... -- R5 --
Destination.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Problem 32 (Homework Set #1) doesn't really make sense in the
context of the "stop-and-wait" protocol presented in the problem
set-up. So ignore that and treat part (a) as assuming that packets are
guaranteed to be delivered in-order and with no losses, part (b) as
in-order with losses possible, and part (c) as potentially out-of-order
delivery and with potential losses. Do the best you can, and it is
always worthwhile to make your assumptions explicit in your answer to
the questions.<br>
  </li>
  <li>All students on the Wait List are being "swept" into the course.
No word yet on a new room, and it is looking bleak!&nbsp; :-(</li>
  <li>Per your requests, we are placing the notes in "2-up handout"
format for your reading pleasure.</li>
  <li>Discussion sections commence this week. You may attend any
discussion section
Tu-F. Next week you will need to settle on a discussion section as that
TA will be grading your programming projects! Also we are taking
pictures this week so don't miss (some) section!<br>
  </li>
  <li>The TAs will be covering solutions to problems similar to the
first homework set. Note that the textbook has worked solutions to the
checked problems at the back of the book BUT THESE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT
ALWAYS CORRECT! (We remember from our own student days just how
frustrating this can be, and will try to head that off in the future).<br>
